# What's For Lunch?
#####What’s for Lunch takes away the decision making process when it comes to choosing a place to eat, for those pivotal moments in life when no one in your group can decide where to go for lunch

#####What’s for Lunch is a web application that integrates with Foursquare and Google services to help make the best choice for you and others in your food adventures.


##Features:

#What’s for Lunch takes into account the places you enjoy, the type of food you enjoy, the amount of time you have, to make the best decision for you.

#What’s for Lunch is able to determine the frequency of visits to prevent the user from becoming “tired” of the same restaurant.
